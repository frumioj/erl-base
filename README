An implementation of Zooko's z-base32 encoding scheme [z-base-32],
with some particulars:

i) Uses the alphabet described in Zooko's proposal 

ii) Assumes that full octets are passed in (ie. doesn't expect 10-bit
strings for example, and will pad to next octet)

iii) Doesn't (yet) decode strings produced from bit strings which
don't come from full octets. 

iv) Does not pad output with '=' during encoding.
